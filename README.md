### CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index API

### error handling example 

```
Exemplaric error handling - in case the axios call might not work because:

 - The API is down.
 - The request was made incorrectly.
 - The API isnâ€™t giving us the information in the format that we anticipated.

```

### Vue example using axios to consume APIS

```
Following along https://vuejs.org/v2/cookbook/using-axios-to-consume-apis.html

In this example I've been including vue directly with a script tag - since this repository
is for learning purposes.

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue "></script>
 

```

### Include Axios directly

```

For this example you have to make sure to include axios directly too within the index.html 

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue "></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
 
```
